# Experimental Bazel registry

This is an experimental Bazel registry.
Once a module is stable I try to move it to the [Bazel Central Registry](https://registry.bazel.build/).

You can add this registry in your `.bazelrc` file via:

```
common --registry=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Vertexwahn/bazel-registry/main/
```
